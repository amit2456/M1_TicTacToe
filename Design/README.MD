ANALYSIS AND MODLING
# Analysis - Analysis is detailed study of the various operations performed by a system and their relationship between within and outside is collected on the available files decision and transaction handled by the present system. All the logical aspect of the system is conversed in the phase.Analysis is the most important phase in the system of a system. In analysis phase one has to study the existing system in detail and also collect necessary information regarding the system to be designed. Hence in this phase flowchart and DFD are made indicating the data flow in the system, and then only can a system be made correct otherwise it will be incorrect. Analysis is conducted with the following objective in mind:
•	Identify the customer need.
•	Evaluate the system concept for feasibility.
•	Perform economic and technical analysis.

SYSTEM DESIGN

Sub Systems
 It is the process of assessing the development organization's ability to construct proposed a system. Test is made to see whether reliable hardware and software, technical resources capable of meeting the needs of a proposed system can be acquired or developed by an organization in the required time. While accessing the technical feasibility, the various issues that are considered are system performance, system interfaces, development processes, risks, failure immunity and security.
